This project is a collection of each concept of C# so that I have a frame of reference for
what I know and what I do not.

## If and Else <a name="if_and_else"></a>

The project to showcase this is the **HigherOrLower.Cli** project. This is a simple
game where a user has to guess a number between 0 and 100 in *7* guesses.

I have used If and Else statements here to handle the following logic

- Has the User won the game (guessed the correct number)
- If they haven't
	- Have they guessed Lower than the number or higher than the number
